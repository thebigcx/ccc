# Christian's Programming Language
A C-like programming language with newer features and improvements.

## Features (so far)
- Built-in types with better names e.g. ```uint8```, ```float32```, ```int64```
- Better variable type declaration system e.g. ```var x: uint32*;```, ```var ptr: int32(int32, int8**);```
- Automatic types e.g. ```var x = function();```
